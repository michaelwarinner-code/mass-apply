"""
Generates resume_data.json and coverletter_data.json for one matched
posting, using state/resume_coverletter_prompt.md as the system prompt --
Michael's existing, working content generator (vehicle bank, experience
bank, skill bank, hard rules) verbatim, with only three adaptations for
running headless via the API instead of in a Claude Project chat:
  1. Framing note that this is a system prompt, not project knowledge.
  2. A "needs_clarification" JSON escape hatch for the several places the
     original document says "ask me in the chat before generating" -- there
     is no chat to ask in here, so the model returns that JSON instead and
     this script surfaces it rather than generating anything.
  3. A salutation fallback for when the recruiter name field is blank
     (always true on this track, since there's no recruiter lookup at this
     volume) -- falls back to "Dear Hiring Team," instead of a name-based
     salutation.
Every other rule, bank, and instruction in that document is untouched --
see state/resume_coverletter_prompt.md for the source of truth, this file
does not duplicate or override any of its content.
