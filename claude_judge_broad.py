"""
Fit judgment for the broad-discovery auto-apply track (non-target-list
companies). Kept as a separate function/file from claude_judge.py rather than
modifying judge_fit() directly, so the existing target-list pipeline's
behavior can't regress from changes made for this new track.

Adds one gate on top of the same role-fit logic used everywhere else: the
company's CORE business must be software. A role being remote, tech-adjacent,
or at a company that "uses" software doesn't qualify -- software has to be
the actual product being sold.
