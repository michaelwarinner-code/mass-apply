"""
Detects application questions that are inherently specific to one company
or role -- "why are you excited about this role," "why do you want to work
here" -- and should NEVER be saved to the reusable answer bank the way
"are you authorized to work in the US" is. A stored answer to one of these
would get matched via semantic similarity against a differently-worded
version of the same question at a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT company, producing
an obviously wrong, off-topic answer.

Keyword-based (like eeo_answers.py's classifier) rather than semantic,
since the pattern here is about question SHAPE, not needing judgment.
