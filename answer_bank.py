"""
The answer bank for recurring application-form questions (work authorization,
sponsorship, years of experience in X, salary expectations, start date, etc).

Storage: state/answer_bank.json, a list of entries:
    {"answer": str, "aliases": [known question phrasings], "added_date": iso date}

Matching a NEW question against the bank uses Claude rather than exact string
matching, since the same question gets phrased differently across companies
("Are you legally authorized to work in the US?" vs "Do you require
sponsorship, now or in the future?"). When a match is found, the new phrasing
gets added as an alias on that entry (consolidation) rather than creating a
near-duplicate entry -- so the bank converges toward one entry per real
question over time instead of accumulating variants.
