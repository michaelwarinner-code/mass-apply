"""
Broad job discovery for the auto-apply track (non-target-list companies).

Searches the Fantastic Jobs API (RapidAPI pay-as-you-go tier) across a set of
marketing/growth keywords, then keeps only postings whose apply URL is hosted
on Greenhouse or Ashby -- those are the only two ATS platforms the Playwright
applier (built separately) knows how to fill out. The board token is parsed
straight out of the apply URL, then handed to the existing ats_fetchers.py
fetch_greenhouse()/fetch_ashby() so the actual posting data (full description,
structured location, application form schema) comes from the clean ATS API,
not from the aggregator's own (possibly truncated) copy.

VERIFIED against a live RapidAPI Playground screenshot: host is
active-jobs-db.p.rapidapi.com, path is /active-ats, and the real param names
are `title`, `location` (quoted country string, e.g. '"United States"'),
`time_frame`, `limit`, `offset`, `description_format`. The response field
names below (job.get("url")/("company_name")/etc.) are still unverified --
confirm those against a real response the first time this actually runs,
and adjust the field lookups in discover_greenhouse_ashby_postings() if
they don't match (the constants above are already correct, don't need to
change again).

time_frame is "7d", not "24h". Already-judged postings (any verdict) are
tracked by URL in auto_apply_state.json and never re-judged or re-billed
on a later run regardless of window size, so a wider window costs nothing
in duplicate work -- it only means a posting doesn't have to be discovered
within the first 24h of going live to ever be seen at all. 24h was the
original default and silently meant any posting older than a day when this
runs was permanently invisible to discovery, judge quality aside.
